# Home Budgeting

This repository contains a simple monthly home budgeting app.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser to track your income and expenses for each month. The app now uses 95% of your screen width to provide a wider workspace.

### Month Controls
You can now add a new budget month or switch between months using the inline controls in the header.

### Button Styles
Delete and edit buttons now mirror the shape of primary actions while using a distinct secondary color for clarity.

### Transactions View
The transaction form appears above the monthly history, which now sits alongside a horizontal bar chart summarising spend by category. The list and chart each occupy half the screen for a clear 50/50 split.

## Tests
Run `npm test` to verify the project is set up correctly.
