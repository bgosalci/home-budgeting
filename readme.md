# Home Budgeting

This repository contains a simple monthly home budgeting app.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser to track your income and expenses for each month. The app now uses 95% of your screen width to provide a wider workspace.

### Month Controls
You can now add a new budget month or switch between months using the inline controls in the header.

### Button Styles
Delete and edit buttons now mirror the shape of primary actions while using a distinct secondary color for clarity.

### Money In Editing
Income entries can now be edited. Use the new edit button next to each income to modify its name or amount.

### Transactions Layout
The Expenditure per Category chart has been removed. The Transactions tab now uses a two-column layout with Monthly Transactions on the left and the Add Transaction form on the right.

## Tests
Run `npm test` to verify the project is set up correctly.
