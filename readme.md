# Home Budgeting

This repository contains a simple monthly home budgeting app.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser to track your income and expenses for each month. The app now uses 95% of your screen width to provide a wider workspace.

### Month Controls
You can now add a new budget month or switch between months using the inline controls in the header.

## Tests
Run `npm test` to verify the project is set up correctly.
